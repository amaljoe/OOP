public class Shapes{

}

// Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty
// method named numberOfSides( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and
// Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the 
// classes contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the 
// given geometrical structures. (Exercise to understand polymorphism). **
